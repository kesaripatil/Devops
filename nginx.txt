** Health Checks
 - It offers 2 types of health checks to check if upstream server(actual servers serving requests) are up and running
	1. passive - available in open source version - nginx : It tracks the status when client makes request to server
	2. active - available in paid version - nginx plug : It allows LB to make regular requests to upstream to check if it is responding with proper status or not.

** Load balance between 2 http servers

	upstream backendServers {
		server 10.0.0.8:80 weight = 1;
		server www.testweb.com:80 weight = 2;
		server spare.testweb.com:80 backup;
	}
	server {
		location / {
			proxy_pass http://backendServers;
		}	
	}

	- weight param instruct nginx to pass twice connection to server2 than server1
	-

signals - [stop|reload|quit|reopen]
