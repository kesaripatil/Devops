Arithmetic operator -

echo "5+5"| bc

1. "export" - cmd
	Export variable to get it in another variable.
	but reverse is not possible, we can't get changed value of variable outside of it's scope.

	Ex ->
		file name => hi.sh
	
		file code =>
			#!/bin/sh

			echo $NAME;
			NAME="Test export cmd";
			echo $NAME;

		Output Without export =>
			<blank line>
			Test export cmd

		Output With export =>
			$ NAME="Value exported from export"
			$ export NAME
			$ ./hi.sh
			  Value exported from export
			  Test export cmd

2. "source" script
	In order to receive environment changes back from the script, we must source the script - this effectively runs the script within our own interactive shell, instead of spawning another shell to run it.
We can source a script via the "." (dot) command.

	Ex -> 
		NAME="test name"
		echo $NAME
		. ./hi.sh
		test name
		Test export cmd
		echo $NAME
		Test export cmd
